This 8-Grid Word Game CSE Mini Project displays grid of eight empty tiles and eight letters of a meaningful word in jumbled fashion. In order to start the game the user has to click on any letter at a time so that it moves to the empty space to obtain a meaningful word. The length of the word should be minimum of three letters. It also contains time limit and target score. If the player reaches target score then he enters next level and if he does not achieve the target score then the game is over and he has to start from the first level. This final year computer science engineering mini project was developed under java & Oracle.
